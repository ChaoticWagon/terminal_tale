# Terminal Story

## Description

This is an interactive story told through a terminal window. The user will explore the story by entering terminal commands guided by the program.
The program will be hosted on a website that anyone can visit.

This program is written in Rust using Bevy Engine and compiled to web assembly to be displayed on a website.

## Story

The story is about a cybersecurity event that happened in 2017 called WannaCry.
The story is told through "phases" that will change perspectives.

### Phase 1

The first phase will introduce the topic in the perspective of the hacker.
Commands will be entered showing the development of the malware, so that the user gets
an idea of how dangerous it was. Then the user will enter a command and deploy the virus to the world.

### Phase 2

The perspective will change to a cybersecurity analyst called Marcus Hutchins.

Starts off with a news report about the virus spreading. Marcus is analyzing the virus and trying to find a way to stop it.
While posting his findings on Twitter. Marcus finds a domain in the code of the virus that was unregistered. 
He then registers the domain and the virus stops spreading. Many people still do not know how the virus was stopped to this day.

### Phase 3

The perspective will change to me, Nathan Bonano.

I will explain the story of how I found out about the story of Marcus Hutchins and how it inspired me to pursue a career in cybersecurity.
I started refining my skills in programming and cybersecurity. Eventually getting internships and majoring in computer science.
